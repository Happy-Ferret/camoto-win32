Camoto: Classic-game Modding Tools

Camoto is a collection of utilities for editing (modding) "classic games",
those from the early to mid 1990s.

This is a Visual Studio build environment for Camoto.  It will build all the
command-line tools, GUI and test code.  It has only been tested in Visual
Studio 2013 Community Edition.

Step-by-step instructions for setting up and building the full Camoto suite
are available at http://www.shikadi.net/camoto/help/build/win32

No source code is included here - it must be downloaded separately (typically
from the git repositories for each Camoto component.)

Dependencies (e.g. Boost) should download automatically on the first build,
via NuGet packages.  wxWidgets still needs to be downloaded manually.
